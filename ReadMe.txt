Notes: 	
	PART 1:
	By default, the program will run from the command line. However, if there is issues with that, there is the
	opportuntiy in the code to hardcode the location of the textfile being used.

	Currently, I have left the 3 textfiles in the "test" folder within my project. In order to access the files
	there through hardcoding, test/ must come before the name of the file.
